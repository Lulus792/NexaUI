# Aetheri desktop model: initial dock view

This separate C17 consumer builds against an installed NexaUI SDK and an
explicit Aetheri source snapshot. It borrows the original desktop model and
font bytes; it returns Search, Settings and Terminal intents to the caller.
The view does not start processes, mutate the Aetheri model, create a Wayland
connection or select a privileged role. A pending app request disables its
corresponding button. The host remains responsible for validating and acting
on every intent and observing the real operation outcome.

```sh
cmake -S /path/to/copied-example -B build \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/nexaui-sdk \
  -DAETHERI_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/aetheri-snapshot
cmake --build build
./build/aetheri_desktop_view_test /path/to/font.ttf
```

This is an initial dock view, not a complete shell adapter. Search contents,
window activation, real native input and IME, borrowed-surface presentation,
AT-SPI publication, scaling, multi-output ownership and the original process
owner integration remain open. The test uses synthetic context events and
semantic requests; it does not establish actual Aetheri or human acceptance.
